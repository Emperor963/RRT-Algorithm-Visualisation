# RRT-Algorithm-Visualisation
This is a project that aims to develop upon the RRT algorithm used extensively in motion planning. As of right now it is a simple path planning algorithm implemented on python using the pygame library. 
What are the future developments?
The main aim of this project is to create a novel path planning algorithm that uses a cost function to select the most optimum tree. The project was inspired from real world physical optimisation principles, something that will be elaborated later


Currently, WIP.
